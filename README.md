# clu-state

This is the state repository for Clu, holding persistent long-term memories and eventually other bits of state. This repository should be committed and pushed by the robot itself regularly, but only modified by an administrator rarely and under special circumstances. Scripts for committing and pushing to this repository may not deal well with the upstream repository chaging - and if there are conflicts, all bets are definitely off.
